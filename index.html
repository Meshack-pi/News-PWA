                  The Marakwet community is a sub-tribe of the Kalenjin group living in the North Western part of Rift-Valley in Kenya. They are mostly found in two counties which is Elgeyo-Marakwet and Uasin Gishu. In addition, they are Nilotes which means that their main source of living is farming and keeping livestocks. These livestocks consists of many cattle, goats and sheep. As of from the 21st century, most of them have undergone civilization hence switching to having businesses rather that herding cattle. The main reason is that most of their needs are not satisfied by the products of the livestock yet they need a healthy living.</p>
